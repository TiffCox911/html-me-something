    <p>Shooting pool is one of the most relaxing thing you can do. Shooting pool makes me feel as if I have no care in the world.
    Although it's a competitive sport, it doesn't alway feel like one. I know the person playing against me is competing. But to be
      honest, I find that I am only competing against myself. I don't say that to be cocky. I say that because I am always trying
      to do better than the last time I shot pool. To put in another way, my only goal is beating my old score.

     <p class= "details">I have a few card games I like to play. However, unlike my other hobbies, playing cards make my 
      competitive side come out. It's fun when I am winning but stressful when I am losing. Playing cards
      is a game I hate losing, especially when the players are trash talking. However, who likes to lose 
      card games, let alone any game.

     <h2>3rd Hobby is Running or Jogging in the Park</h2>

     <p> Walking and jogging in the park in my number 1 preferred method of exercising. I really clear my mind was walking or jogging. The best way to do either is with music playing on your headphones. 
      I am often in my own world when doing so. Not to mention, I feel like a completely different person after I jogging and/or walk. The downside is 
      I don't get to walk in the park as much as I would like to. Hopefully that changes soon, considering I just moved
      3 minutes away from a park.
